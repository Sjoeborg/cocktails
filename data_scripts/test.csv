Blue Blazer;"You will need a pair of large silver-plated tankards (blazer mugs) with handles. Preheat these with boiling water and warm the whisky.

Then mix ingredients by pouring them from one tankard to the other. The foolhardy increase the distance between the tankards as they pour, thus creating a spectacular long blue flame between the two. Extinguish flame by covering flaming tankard with base of the other tankard, pour into glass and sweeten to taste by stirring in powdered sugar.

The cocktail and soda should form a single stream of liquid falling into the glass.

As when pouring a Guinness, to achieve a perfect head on a Ramos Gin Fizz, the cocktail should be left to settle for at least a minute before topping off with what remains in the shaker. Ideally, during the settling period, the glass should be placed in a glass froster/fridge/freezer. As the final contents of the shaker are poured into the glass so the head should rise like a souffle.

Some Ramos Gin Fizz recipes, and indeed Henry Charles Ramos' original recipe, call for old tom gin (also our preference), in which case you may need to reduce the amount of sugar syrup depending on your old tom, personal tastes and citrus fruit.";Portobello Old Tom gin|Lemon juice|Lime juice|Sugar syrup|Orange flower blossom water|Vanilla extract|Pasteurised egg white|Single cream half and half|Top up with Thomas Henry Soda Water
